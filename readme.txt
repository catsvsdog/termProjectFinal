Welcome to Outfit Generator!

This program allows users to upload folders with their clothing, and once they 
update the properties of each clothing, such as color, fit, season, etc, they 
can use my program to generate outfits, which are generated following a set of
rules regarding color and fit. The user can also add to a calendar what outfit 
they want to wear on which day. They can also filter outfits based on season.

Run Instructions:

To run my project, first the user needs to download the file of clothing or 
provide their own file. Then the user should run it in main. The user is 
prompted a folder to upload, and once that's complete, the user is then 
directed to a wardrobe layout, where they can update the properties of each 
piece of clothing. Then, the user can create outfits with the clothing they have updated properties of.
